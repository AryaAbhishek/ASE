Step -7 -> Local vs Global Reasoning
Answer ->
    Suvodeep Majumder has given few points in section 2.1 of the paper which he uses to make point for generality(
    Global reasoning) such as -
    Generality - of the software which can hold against different projects
    Trust - that model will not change and the assumtions made previously will still hold
    Insight - (valuable) will be generated using the model for different projects
    Training - will be easier for newcomers
    Tool development - will become easier

    with this he also gave some cases where generality may not hold such as -
        one model may not cover all project and the generality tools also need to know the community of
        within which the conclusion of model will be applied.

    -> I agree with Suvodeep Majumder's reasoning about as when to go general and when to go local as most of
    the project may be able to use a general software model to get valuable insight but it is not always
    necessary that multiple project has to belong to same community and there may be different factor which
    are valued to get insight for that project, in that case it is better to have different local model for that
    project instead of using the general one.
